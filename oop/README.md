# NodeJS OOP Examples

This content shows examples of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) using NodeJS with ES6. This
is done through three (3) different Libraries. The primary purpose of these is to show ways of accessing the object property `debug`.

* test-lib.js
  * Properties set dynamically within the constructor
  * Public properties
* test-lib2.js
  * Properties set dynamically within the constructor via `setOptions()`
  * Private properties
* test-lib3.js
  * Properties set specifically within the constructor
  * Private properties

To run the tests:

```
node oop-test.js
```
